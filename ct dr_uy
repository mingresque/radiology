
No evidence of acute territorial infarct, intracranial hemorrhage or focal mass lesion. Should symptomatology persist or progress, MRI may be done for further evaluation
-
There is no evidence for acute territorial infarct, intracranial hemorrhage or focal mass lesion.
Cisterns and sulci are not effaced. The ventricles are normal in size and configuration. Midline structures are in place.
The cavernous sinuses are symmetrical. The sella and suprasellar regions are intact.
The brainstem and cerebellum are preserved.
The visualized paranasal sinuses and petromastoids are clear and adequately aerated. Orbits are intact.
Visualized osseous structures are intact.

Leftward nasal septal deviation with spur
-
The nasal septum is deviated to the left with spur formation





Consider bilateral maxillary mucus retention cysts and/or polyps
-
Nodular mucosal thickening are seen in both maxillary sinuses. 



.normal GB

-
The liver is not enlarged with smooth contour. Parenchymal attenuation is within normal limits. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are not dilated. No discrete lesion is identified in this non-contrast study.
The gallbladder is physiologically distended without intraluminal calcific lithiasis or wall thickening. No pericholecystic fat stranding seen.
No discrete enlarged abdomino-pelvic lymph nodes or ascites is identified.


.
Epiploic appendagitis, adjacent to the distal descending colon
-
A focal fatty mass is noted adjacent the distal descending colon measuring 1.5 x 0.9 cm (AP x T) with perimetric fat stranding densities and thickened left lateral conal fascia, suggestive of epiploic appendagitis.


Prominent and fluid-filled appendix with appendicolith at the base. No significant periappendiceal inflammation in this examination, however beginning appendicitis and mucocele are not ruled-out. Clinical correlation is advised
-
The appendix is fluid-dilated measuring 1.3 cm at the distal end. Intraluminal hyperdensity is seen at the base, likely an appendicolith. There is however no discrete periappendiceal fat haziness.




Subcentimeter to prominent-sized mesenteric lymph nodes at the right lower hemiabdomen which may relate to mesenteric adenitis
-
Subcentimeter to prominent-sized mesenteric lymph nodes are seen at the right lower hemiabdomen up to 1 cm in sizes.


Urinary bladder wall thickening may be from underdistention, cannot rule-out cystitis
-
The urinary bladder is underdistended with apparent wall thickening.


Fecal retention
-
Fecal materials are seen throughout the colon.
Fecal materials are seen within the colon.


Intimal calcifications are seen throughout the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries.



Osteopenia
-
Fecal materials are seen throughout the colon.

Mild degenerative osseous changes
-
Minimal spurs are seen along the bone margins. No lytic or blastic changes are identified.





Subsegmental atelectasis and/or fibrosis, middle and left lower lobes
-
Linear densities at the middle and left lower lobes may be from subsegmental atelectasis and/or fibrosis.


Incidentally, subsegmental atelectasis and/or fibrosis is noted at the middle and both lower lobes. Mosaic attenuation is also seen at the lower lobes which may be from small airways disease or infectious/inflammatory process.
