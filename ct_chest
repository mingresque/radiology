Bilateral upper and middle lung zone emphysema
-
Emphysematous changes are seen in both upper and middle lung zones.

Above lung findings are ascribed to pulmonary tuberculosis with CT signs of activity
-
Reticulonodular opacities with tree in bud pattern are seen in both lungs except the lingula.


.dr_vizcarra mod_ct part_chest
Overall lung findings may relate to infection such as tuberculosis, follow up in 8 weeks is recommended 
-
There is consolidation in both upper lobes, lingula and left lower lobe. There is associated cavitations in the left upper and left lower lobe. 
Numerous noncalcified nodules are noted in both lungs measuring up to 2.9 x 2.2cm in the superior segment of the right lower lobe. One of the nodule in the left lower lobe also shows cavitation.

Few centrilobular nodules in the upper lobes may relate to an infectious process such as tuberculosis 
- 
Few centrilobular nodules with tree in bud pattern are seen in both upper lobes.

Regression in the reticulonodular densities in the left upper lobe; the rest of the reticulonodular densities seen in both lungs with associated bronchiectatic changes and focal consolidation in the upper lobes are the same; findings may relate to tuberculosis
-
There is regression in the reticulonodular densities in the left upper lobe. The rest of the reticulonodular densities seen in both lungs with associated bronchiectatic changes and focal consolidation in the upper lobes are the same.

Diffuse ground glass with mosaic attenuation ascribed to air trapping, consider Non-fibrosing Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis, typical; follow up in 3 months is recommended 
-
There is slight progression in the extent of the diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lungs. The pattern is predominantly upper lung in distribution. The HRCT scan dated September 14, 2021 shows marked regression in the diffuse ground glass opacities when compared to previous studies. Afterwards, there is progression in the ground glass opacities. The previously reported air cysts and traction bronchiectasis are not delineated in this examination.

Previously reported reticulonodular densities in the superior segment of the right lower lobe shows dense periphery with central lucency and spiculated margin. Findings favor infection such as tuberculosis and fungal infection over malignancy, follow up is also recommended 
-
The previously reported reticulonodular densities in the superior segment of the right lower lobe shows dense periphery with central lucency and measures 2.8 x 2.6cm (stable size) with spiculated margin.

Bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis in both lower lobes with subpleural reticular densities in the bilateral upper and middle lobes are consistent with a probable UIP pattern; the cause could be idiopathic, collagen vascular disease or medication 
-
REGULAR HRCT:
There is volume loss with bronchiectatic, bronchiolectatic and fibrotic changes in the bilateral lower lobes. 
Subpleural reticular densities are in both upper lobes, lateral segment of the middle lobe and lingula. 
No pulmonary nodules, masses and honeycombing seen. 
INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY SCAN: There is no apparent change in the degree of expansion of both lower lobes on the inspiratory and expiratory sequences, with no significant areas of mosaic attenuation that may suggest air trapping. 
PRONE: There is persistence of the reticular densities seen in the supine scan. The fibrotic changes in seen in approximately 20% of both lungs.

Sclerotic changes at T1, T10 and T11, concerning for metastatic spread in the background of known malignancy. Bone scan is recommended 
-
Sclerotic changes are seen at the T1, T10 and T11 vertebrae, primarily in the posterior elements.
