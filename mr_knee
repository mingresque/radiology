-
Follow-up study shows a complex tear of the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus extending to the anterior root with background degeneration and adjacent parameniscal cysts with aggregate measurement of 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm (AP x T x CC).

Myxoid degeneration of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus
-
Myxoid degeneration of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus is seen.

Mild sprains of the medial and lateral collateral ligaments
-
Minimal fluid signals are seen surrounding the medial collateral ligament representing a mild sprain. Intrasubstance intermediate signals in the lateral collateral ligament also relating to a sprain noted.

Confluence with increase in the size of the ganglion cysts adjacent to the posterior cruciate ligament
-
The subcentimeter cysts relating to ganglion cysts, posterior to the posterior cruciate ligament shows confluence with increase in size, with an aggregate measurement of 1.2 x 1.2 x 2.6 cm (AP x T x CC).

Non-demonstration of the intraosseous and subchondral cysts in the posterior aspect of the medial tibial condyle
-
The small intra-osseous subchondral cysts in the posterior aspect of the medial tibial plateau are no longer seen.

Interval increase in the amount of joint effusion with probable synovitis, suprapatellar plica and calcified loose body in the suprapatellar bursa
-
Minimal fluid is still evident in the central knee joint space. There is also emergence of minimal fluid in the suprapatellar bursa with a calcified loose body and prominence of the synovium. A suprapatellar plica is observed.

Minimal subcutaneous edema at the anterior aspect of the knee
-
Minimal subcutaneous edema is seen in the anterior aspect of the knee.

Full-thickness cartilage loss at the posterior lateral femoral condyle
-
Stable full thickness cartilage loss in the posterior aspect of the lateral femoral condyle is seen still measuring 1.4 cm in length.

Small medial femoral trochlear osteochondral injury
-
The full-thickness cartilage loss with underlying cortical erosion at the medial femoral trochlea is unchanged. However, there is resolution of the underlying subchondral edema.

Partial thickness cartilage loss, lateral patellar facet
-
Partial thickness cartilage loss in the lateral patellar facet is stable.

Ovoid osseous structure within the distal patellar tendon which may represent an ossicle, enthesophyte or fragmented tibial protuberance from prior apophysitis; please correlate clinically.

Degenerative osseous changes
-
Stable small osteophytes are seen at the margins of the patella, femoral and tibial condyles and tibial eminences.
